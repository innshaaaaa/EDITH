# EDITH
EDITH – The Follow Me Robot’s core is made using Arduino Uno paired with an Ultrasonic sensor. Other parts such as wheels, batteries, etc., will also be used to for mobility and other uses.   Our goal is to design and develop a robot’s prototype which can be used by anyone to provide them with a helping hand to carry any object with them.
